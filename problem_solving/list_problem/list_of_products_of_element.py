Problem Statement #
Implement a function, find_product(lst), which modifies a list so that each index has a product of all the numbers present in the list except the number stored at that index.

Input: #
A list of numbers (could be floating points or integers)

Output: #
A list such that each index has a product of all the numbers in the list except the number stored at that index.

Sample Input #
arr = [1,2,3,4]
Sample Output #
arr = [24,12,8,6]
